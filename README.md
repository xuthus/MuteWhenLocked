Mute Sounds When Desktop Locked

Application mutes sounds when user locks desktop. Automatically. Changes master volume level.

This can be useful at work - you've gone to home, but the music goes on in headphones on your desk...
And your dear colleagues will listen to your favorite grunge music till workstation won't sleep.

The application changes master volume to predefined level each time you lock desktop. And restores it when desktop unlocked.

Now it is tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10, both with UAC turned on.

The application written on Object Pascal using [Lazarus 1.6.4 (Free Pascal 3.0.2)](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/).

You can download compiled build for 64bit Windows [here](http://elcoder.ru/files/lockmute.zip).

In my nearest plans:
* implement the ability to translate the application to other languages
* add hot keys to change volume
* test application on Windows XP, Windows 8, Windows Server Editions
* add 32bit Windows support

May be also I add versions to use in operating systems other than Microsoft Windows.
